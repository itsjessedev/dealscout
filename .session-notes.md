### Session: 2025-12-23 (continued)

**Context:** User asked to "get the web app caught up to the mobile app" while they make dinner.

**Accomplishments:**
- Created API service for web app (`web/src/services/api.ts`) - copied from mobile
- Built Deals page with filtering tabs (Good Deals / Needs Review / All)
- Built Deal Detail page with:
  - Price breakdown (asking, market, repair cost, profit)
  - Condition selector (new/used/repair)
  - Toggleable repair options with cost calculations
  - Purchase modal
  - Dismiss functionality
- Dark theme styling matching mobile app

**Commits Made:**
- `1eff6d3`: Web app: Add API service, Deals page, and Deal Detail page

**Still TODO (Web App Catchup):**
- [ ] Build Current Flips page (with eBay/FB list buttons)
- [ ] Build List Item page (eBay listing form)
- [ ] Build Profits page (stats/analytics)
- [ ] Build Settings page
- [ ] Add navigation/layout component
- [ ] Update App.tsx with all routes
- [ ] Add auth flow
- [ ] Deploy to VPS and test

**Mobile App Reference (features to match):**
- DealsScreen.tsx - Deal cards with filtering
- DealDetailScreen.tsx - Full deal info, repair options, purchase
- CurrentFlipsScreen.tsx - Active inventory with eBay/FB buttons, auto-sync
- ListItemScreen.tsx - eBay listing creation with AI suggestions
- ProfitsScreen.tsx - Stats and analytics
- SettingsScreen.tsx - App settings, eBay account linking

**Notes:**
- Web app uses React Router (already set up)
- Same API service as mobile (types match backend)
- Dark theme colors: bg #0f0f1a, card #1a1a2e, accent #4ecca3, repair #ff9800
